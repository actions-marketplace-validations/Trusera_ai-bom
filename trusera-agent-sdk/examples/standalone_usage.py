"""
Example usage of the StandaloneInterceptor for local HTTP monitoring and policy enforcement.

This example demonstrates how to use the standalone interceptor without
connecting to the Trusera platform. Useful for:
- Local development and testing
- Air-gapped environments
- Proof-of-concept deployments
- CI/CD pipeline integration
