"""Scanner modules for AI-BOM detection.

Importing this package triggers auto-registration of all scanner classes
via the __init_subclass__ hook in BaseScanner.

Available scanners:
    - CodeScanner: Detects AI libraries and frameworks in source code
    - DockerScanner: Detects AI services in Docker/Kubernetes deployments
    - NetworkScanner: Detects AI endpoints and credentials in config files
    - CloudScanner: Detects AI services in Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.
    - N8nScanner: Detects AI components in n8n workflow automation
    - ASTScanner: Deep AST-based Python analysis (--deep flag)
    - GitHubActionsScanner: Detects AI components in GitHub Actions workflows
    - JupyterScanner: Detects AI components in Jupyter notebooks
    - ModelFileScanner: Detects AI model binary files
    - MCPConfigScanner: Detects MCP server configurations
    - AWSLiveScanner: Scans live AWS account for AI/ML services (optional)
    - GCPLiveScanner: Scans live GCP project for AI/ML services (optional)
    - AzureLiveScanner: Scans live Azure subscription for AI/ML services (optional)
